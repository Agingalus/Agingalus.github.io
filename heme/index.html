            <p class="tab"> There are many different types of juggling, each one has its own style to it and feel to it. One of the most basic types is juggling balls. Although it may be simplest, it is still quite a feat to accomplish. From there many of the devout
                jugglers move on to juggling clubs. These clubs are not to be confused with bowling pins, which are much heavier and very hard to juggle. The clubs jugglers use are specially designed for juggling. When thrown up they will naturally rotate,
                making it easier to always catch it on the right end (which is very important when doing torches or knives).

                After getting used to juggling clubs, there are many other different things to learn. Some people choose to stick just with just juggling but most people choose to broaden there horizon. Some of the things jugglers move to are: ring, poi, spinning staff,
                contact staff, dragon staff, poi, ropedart, levi-wand, hula-hoop, diablo, and devilsticks. There is so much to learn in the world of juggling, that one will never run out of thing to learn. It is something that every one can do and enjoy.
                It is not something that is only for the super coordinated but is accessible to all. I urge the reader to give it a go... It may just change your life.

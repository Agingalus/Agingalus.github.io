        <p class="tab">Some people start with juggling others just got straight to other arts
            in the same family as juggling. Each one has its own feel to it, but many of them

            <h2>Dragon Staff</h2>
            <p class="tab">Dragon staffs are ussualy 5 foot long poles with what looks like an X on each end.
                One minipulates the staff by rolling it on ones body. As long as it rolling down 
                it wil gain momentem and keep spining. Depeding on how fast it is spinning the 
                X at the end will start to look like a circle rather than four individual points.

           <p class="tab">Poi was originaly developed in New Zealand, and was used in dances for tell stories 
               of the people. Now it has taken off into the modern world. It is constently gorwing 
               at an extrealy fast rate. It has become a performence art and a way to enter ones 
               flow state and just genoraly have fun. It is has some similary to clubs spining.
               Since it it done with string with a ball at the end instead of a solid peice,
               it has much more flexablity to do many more thing with it. Poi is on of the most 
               commen props to do long expoure photography. It can create beutiful designs,
               espetaly when done with fire.

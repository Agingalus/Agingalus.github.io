            <p class="tab">Juggling clubs are dynamicly different from balls. Although they are usualy the next stepping
                stones after balls,
                they will probobly take more time to learn than learning balls did originaly. It is the same steps as
                learning balls, but unlike balls, you never have to worry about the rotaion. With balls no matter how high
                you throw
                it you can catch it with out a problem, with clubs there is only one right side. This same thing also gives
                clubs a completely differet look. With clubs throwing it higher and making it do more rotations is a
                trick on
                its own. Even the most basic trick looks much more impressive with clubs.

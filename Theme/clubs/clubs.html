        <p class="tab">Juggling clubs are dinamicly differet from balls. Although they are usualy the next stepping
            stones after balls,
            they will probobly take more time to learn than learning balls did originaly. It is the same steps as
            learning balls, but unlike balls you never have to worry about the rotaion. With balls no matter how high
            you throw
            it you can catch it with out a problem, with clubs there is only one right side. This same thing also give
            clubs the a compleatly differet look. With clubs throwing it higher and making it do more rotations is a
            trick on
            its own. Even the most basic trick looks much more impressive with clubs.

            <p class="tab"> When people talk about passing in juggling, they usualy refer to passing with
                clubs. Ocationaly you will see basic passing done with balls just for beginers, but all
                of the more complex patterns are done with clubs. It could be just for the simple reason
                that they are bigger and therefor easier to see, by both the jugglers and spectators.

            <h3>The social aspect</h3>
            <p class="tab">
                Passing clubs has become almost a social event. It is a time to get together with all other jugglers
                and to work with every one to create a working pattern. The entire pattern is only as strong as its
                weakest link. The more advanced jugglers help out the newer ones to help the progress. This builds
                unity between the jugglers and creates a special enviorment to be in. One that make passing a
                favorate for many jugglers.

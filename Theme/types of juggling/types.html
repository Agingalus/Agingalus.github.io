        <h2>Comedy juggling</h1>
            <p class="tab">
                Many people like adding a little juggling to there comedy show and market it as a juggling show.
                Although much of what people do when doing comedy juggling is not classifyed as juggling, the things
                that they do do can be extrealy hard. Besides they have to come up with all sorts of jokes and
                keep the people entertained, they also have to act the part while juggling. It is much easy to just
                consetrate on your jugging, but make you juggling goofy can be the hardest part. It might suprise you
                but trying to make a mistake for show, is sometimes harder then not makeing the mistatake at all.
                People practice so much how to do it right that it becomes such habit that they have touble stoping it.

            <p class="tab">Circus juggling is very showy, and is looks good from all direction. Ussualy jugglers
                perform on
                a stage so they only have to face one direction. Circus jugglers do not have that luxery. Many times
                they
                will also include some acrobatics in there jugging. Which is a skill on its own. To fufull the clasic
                what
                at a circus they also bring out a very tall unicyle to juggle on.

                Some people prefer to so juggling in a much more offical setting. They ususaly are wearing full suits.
                They not only have different styles of juggling but also use different props. Amonge these props are:
                canes, hats, gloves, or wine bottles. I has become its own style. There is not right style. Each one
                tell you somthing about the person doing the juggling.
            </p>
            <h2>Causal jugging</h2>
            <p class="tab"> Of cource not every one wants to have a performce style. Some people just leave it as hobby
                and they just do what ever they feel like at that time. The creat abstract ways to juggle that other
                people may not have done yet. With juggling every style is exepted and incourged.

                <p class="tab">
                    Many people like adding a little juggling to there comedy show and market it as a juggling show.
                    Although much of what people do when doing comedy juggling is not classified as juggling, the things
                    that they do do can be extreamly hard. Besides they have to come up with all sorts of jokes and
                    keep the people entertained, they also have to act the part while juggling. It is much easier to just
                    concentrate on your juggling, but make your juggling goofy can make it even harder. It might suprise you
                    but trying to make a mistake for show, is sometimes harder then not making the mistake at all.
                    People practice so much how to do it right that it becomes such habit that they have touble stopping it.

                <p class="tab">Circus juggling is very showy, and is looks good from all direction. Ussualy jugglers
                    perform on
                    a stage so they only have to face one direction. Circus jugglers do not have that luxury. Many times
                    they
                    will also include some acrobatics in thier juggling., which is a skill on its own. To fulfill the clasic
                    want
                    at a circus, they also bring out a very tall unicyle to juggle on.

                    Some people prefer to so juggling in a much more offical setting. They ususaly are wearing full suits.
                    They not only have different styles of juggling but also use different props. Amonge these props are:
                    canes, hats, gloves, or wine bottles. It has become its own style. There is not right style. Each one
                    tell you somthing about the person doing the juggling.

            <section id="causal">
                <h2>Causal jugging</h2>
                <p class="tab"> Of cource not every one wants to have a performce style. Some people just leave it as hobby
                    and they just do what ever they feel like at that time. They create abstract ways to juggle that other
                    people may not have done yet. With juggling every style is accepted and encouraged.

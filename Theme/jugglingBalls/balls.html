            <p class="tab">Juggling the balls is what most people start with. It is the simplest and the easyest way
                understand
                what it realy feels like to juggle. Althought it is where people start it in not mean to say that it
                is simple. Far from it, there are so many things that people can do with balls it is spactacual. Some
                people start learing cool tricks and minipulartion of the ball. Others go strait to number juggling.
                People commenly go for juglging 5 balls, but some people are even know to go up to 11 balls!

            <h2>How to juggle three balls for a klutz</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Go out to the store and get three juggling balls. If you have them already then you can skip right to
                    step two.</li>
                <li>Before one can get in to the nitty griry of learning to juggling, one has to exept a single fact.
                    They will be bending down to pick up objects many times, and that is not only O.K. but also exepted.
                    to master this firsts step, I recommend getting three juggling balls and holding them in your hands.
                    When you are ready hold two in the right hand and one in the left (reverced for leftys). Then throw
                    then up and make absolutly no effort to chatch them. Listen to the sound they make when the hit the
                    floor. Enjoy that sound. It will soon be a very commen sound to your ears. If you have not compleatly
                    understood this, feel free to reapeat this as many times as nessesary until you feel comfterable with
                    this.
                </li>
                <li>
                    This step is probobly the most improtant step and the one that very few people spend enough time on.
                    Althought it sound very simple, if not mastered everthing else will take much longer to learn. You will
                    need to learn to throw one ball from hand to hand. Start with the ball in one hand, does not matter
                    which. You will want to be able to throw it at about eye level hight to the other hand. You want to
                    make
                    sure that you are not chasing the ball around. Until you learn to thorw one ball their is not way you
                    can learn to juggle three objects.
                </li>
                <li>After being able to constistently throw one ball back and forth at a consistent hight, you are ready
                    for two balls. Start with one ball in each hand, with the right hand you, throw one ball to the other
                    hand at eye level. When that ball gets to the top of its ark, throw the one from the left hand to the 
                    right. Then do the same thing but starting with the left hand. Repeat this until it feels very comfterable.
                    Remember, getting down the beggining steps solid will make everything down the line easier.
                </li>
                <li>Next we have what is called the snake. It starts with holidng two balls in one hand, which ever hand you 
                    feel more commfterable with. (Dont worry we will get to both hands.) Throw the balls up in secession to 
                    the other hand. You want to make sure that the second ball leaves your hand before the first ball gets to
                    the other hand. You will want to do this with the same hand several times before starting with the other hand.
                    Once you feel comfterable with doing it from both hand you will want to start chaining this prosses.

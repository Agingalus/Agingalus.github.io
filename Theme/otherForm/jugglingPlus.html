            <h2>Dragon Staff</h2>
            <p class="tab">Dragon staffs are ussualy 5 foot long poles with what looks like an X on each end. One minipulates the staff by rolling it on ones body. As long as it rolling down it wil gain momentem and keep spining. Depeding on how fast it is spinning
                the X at the end will start to look like a circle rather than four individual points.

            <p class="tab">Poi was originaly developed in New Zealand, and was used in dances for tell stories of the people. Now it has taken off into the modern world. It is constently gorwing at an extrealy fast rate. It has become a performence art and a way to
                enter ones flow state and just generally have fun. It has some similarities to clubs spinning. Since it it done with string with a ball at the end instead of a solid peice, it has much more flexablity to do many more thing with it. Poi
                is on of the most common props to do long expoure photography. It can create beautiful designs, especially when done with fire.
